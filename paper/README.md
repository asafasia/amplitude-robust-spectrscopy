# Paper source

The paper has two document entry points: `main.tex` for the PRL Letter and
`supplemental.tex` for the standalone Supplemental Material. Each file's
`\input` list mirrors its reading order.

## Build

From the repository root:

```bash
make paper
```

The PDFs are written to `paper/main.pdf` and `paper/supplemental.pdf`.
To build only one document, use `make paper-main` or
`make paper-supplemental`. To remove intermediate LaTeX files while keeping
the PDFs:

```bash
make paper-clean
```

## Editing conventions

- Keep one logical section per file.
- Prefix main-text filenames with their two-digit reading order.
- Prefix appendix filenames with their appendix letter.
- Put packages and document-wide settings in `preamble.tex`, not section files.
- Put citations in `references.bib`; `archive/legacy_zotero_export.bib` is kept
  only as a source for entries that may be imported later.
- Keep all references cited by the Supplemental Material in the main Letter's
  reference list, as required by APS.
- Keep temporary or superseded figures under `figures/archive/`.
